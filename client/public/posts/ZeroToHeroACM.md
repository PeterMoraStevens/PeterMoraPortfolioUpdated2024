# **How I leveled up my Data Structure and Algorithm skills from 0 to Hero and landed an internship at Uber as a Freshman**

### First I want to preface by saying that this is my personal experience and it will not represent the experience for everyone.

Outline \-

- Prior experience \- what I knew coming into University
- My experience in underclassman programs
- Tools, Techniques and Resources (Sean prashad, leetcode, neetcode)
- How I approached interviews/advice I received from mentors
- Outro explaining that I know current students can do it

Second, the title might be just a little bit clickbait. While I didn’t get an internship at Uber in my first year, I was a part of Uber’s Career Prep program and interviewed the summer of my Freshman year for an internship which would take place during the summer of my second year. As such I only interviewed having the knowledge of my first year.

## **Prior Experience**

Like many other students, I came into university with little to no prior knowledge in computer science. I had taken a single AP CS course which taught me what a bit was and how to define a variable in python. Unfortunately with OSU changing their engineering courses to the 100+ series many students miss out on the opportunity to learn important skills which I will get to soon. The point of this is to say that I was very much in the same spot of not knowing anything and I know that there are some useful resources for those interested in learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms.

## **My Experience in Underclassman Programs**

The first time I heard about Data Structures and Algorithms was when I was looking through youtube videos about internships. The words I heard honestly didn’t even make sense to me at the time. Once I learnt about their existence though I had moved one step in the right direction. Of course I subsequently never thought about them for around 5 months. I thought at the time I had no need for them, I wasn’t going to get any interviews. It was in December when I was reached out to schedule an interview with Uber for their Uber Career Prep program.

It was in all reality, this one opportunity which convinced me to really settle down and start practicing. I honestly didn’t know what to expect or where to start though. So many options felt far too overwhelming. I believe this is probably the best place to begin when it comes to starting your own journey in DSA.

## **Tools, Techniques and Resources**

At a very basic level I want to be clear about what Data Structures and Algorithms actually are… they’re tools. You use these tools to build a solution based on the conditions and requirements proposed to you by either an interviewer or problem statement.

The first thing I was taught when it came to learning Data Structures and Algorithms was that it was best to follow a structured path. I speak for myself when I say this, but learning about data structures and algorithms without a professor made keeping track of progress extremely difficult. In creating a structured list of topics, you are more likely to continue moving forward in your goals as you learn relevant topics which apply to the current data structure you’re studying. For example, if you’re learning about strings and arrays, learning about two pointers is probably a good idea as well.

That last bit might not have made much sense, but I’ll do my best to explain what I mean. A tool I personally recommend for those with little to no DSA experience is [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/). It’s a free website which provides lots of relevant material for practicing DSA in an organized way through the use of the provided “roadmap”. All the questions in the roadmap have videos associated with them for reference if you’re ever stuck or want more logic for the pattern before trying it fully yourself.

Once you get a hang of the basic patterns, a website I found useful was Sean Prashad’s [LeetCode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/). It provides a list of companies who ask said questions, as well as the option of choosing specific patterns/topics to practice. Lastly, I recommend approaching questions blind once you get the hang of identifying patterns. This way you can test your ability to identify a brand new question using context clues which is similar to how you might approach an interview.

## **How I’d Approach a Behavioral Interview**

Interviews are, contrary to popular belief, the place where you can even the playing field. That’s not to say there won’t be hundreds of different factors at play in any one moment, but you get the opportunity to meet a real person and connect with them. This is my secret tip… it’s about the vibes. That’s a bit cringe, I know, but I’m serious. When you’re speaking with a hiring manager or an interviewer, they’re going to assess how well you can communicate and if you'd make a good co-worker. All you need to do is match the vibe. Now this is obviously easier for some more than others, but it's an hour per interview and most of the time behavorals are 1/2 that. You'll all do great, and I'm excited to hear how your interviews go!
